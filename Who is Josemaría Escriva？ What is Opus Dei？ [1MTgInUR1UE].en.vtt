00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.080
Josemaria Escriva is known
as “the saint of ordinary life.”

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.920
It was Escriva who founded Opus Dei
– meaning “the work of God” –

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.780
on the principle that people can find God

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.350
right in the middle of their everyday lives.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.540
I did not found Opus Dei.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.750
Opus Dei is the work of. . .
it is God’s doing.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.770
All I did was get in the way.
Is that clear?

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.440
Josemaria had a powerful vision:

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.000
that deep spirituality could infuse
every aspect of peoples’ lives,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.530
and they could love and serve God
in their everyday work,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.360
with their families,
and in their friendships.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.750
You and I have to be rebels,
but the kind that gives solutions,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.520
solutions based on justice and charity,
Christian solutions.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.760
He was a priest who spent his life
teaching ordinary people that living for God

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.640
is not just for priests and nuns.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.510
Be holy as my heavenly Father is holy.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.330
And he says this not just to those of us
who wear these things

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.400
but to everyone,
to everyone!

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.630
People of every nation, race, and social condition

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.780
could live the Christian calling
in a new way:

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.940
by striving to be holy
in the ordinary circumstances of their lives.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.800
To husbands, to wives, to single people,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.780
to workers, to intellectuals,
to farmers, to everyone!

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.760
WHO WAS JOSEMARIA ESCRIVA?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.280
THE EARLY YEARS
(1902-1928)

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.270
Josemaria Escriva’s openness to the will of God
began at an early age.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520
Born into a devoutly Catholic family,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.660
Josemaría would recite all his life
the prayers his mother taught him.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.240
He suffered many hardships as a child.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.400
His three younger sisters died.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.580
His father’s business collapsed
and the family had to move

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.000
to another city
where they struggled to get by.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.460
When he was 15 he began to sense
that God had a special mission for him.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.360
He had dreamed of being an architect,
but instead became a priest,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.630
to be ready for whatever
God was asking,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.400
praying fervently,
“Lord, let me see what you want.”

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.420
During a retreat in Madrid,
God showed him what he wanted.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.360
It was Opus Dei,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.060
a part of the Catholic Church
that spreads the remarkable message

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.310
that a person can find holiness
in ordinary life.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.150
Father Josemaría would dedicate
his whole life to developing Opus Dei.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.000
Whenever he was asked
about what happened that day,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.720
he would simply respond,
“I saw Opus Dei.”

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.420
But I think it’s clear from
that very moment, he understood

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.790
that ordinary Christians were called to holiness
in their work and in the middle of the world,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.270
and that he was called to start
an organization that would spread that message.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.690
FIRST STEPS
(1928-1936)

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.370
The circumstances could not have been
more challenging.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.550
Escriva was a poor, unknown priest

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.690
- no financial resources,
helpers or patrons.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.810
1930’s Spain was boiling
with anti-clericalism…

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.920
priests were under attack.
Churches and convents were burned.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.560
Nevertheless, relying
on the power of prayer,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.100
he set out on a search for people
who could understand his message

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.400
and dedicate their lives to spreading it.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.830
Surrounded by political turmoil
which was often violent,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.150
Escrivá refused to take sides
and taught his followers

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.550
to understand pluralism
and to love and respect freedom.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.540
Growth was slow.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.400
After eight years, less than twenty people
had joined Opus Dei.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.150
Then war broke out.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.100
TRIAL BY WAR
(1936-1939)

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.190
The Spanish Civil War brought
even fiercer religious persecution.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.780
Thousands of priests and nuns were murdered.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.800
Father Josemaría was forced
to abandon his clerical dress

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.640
and to go into hiding in Madrid,
moving from place to place

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.840
to avoid capture and death.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.480
For a while he hid in an insane asylum,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.360
pretending to be mentally ill.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.340
Later he and a few members of Opus Dei

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.440
found refuge in the Consulate of Honduras

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.200
where they lived in a single room.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.790
During this time he still ministered
to many people,

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.360
at times risking his life to do so.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.620
This was a time of great danger
for all priests,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.470
but Father Josemaría felt he could not simply
sit out the war in hiding,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.470
unable to carry out his priestly activities
or work at the development of Opus Dei.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.200
So he decided to try to escape
to the Nationalist Zone,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.450
where religious activities were permitted.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.280
In the fall of 1937, Escrivá
traveled incognito to Barcelona

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.330
and from there
joined a group of smugglers

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.620
for a series of dangerous night marches
through the Pyrenees Mountains

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.940
into Andorra.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.030
For the remainder of the war he struggled
to reestablish contact

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.200
with the members
and friends of Opus Dei.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.800
The civil war left Spain destroyed.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.840
A few months later the Nazis invaded Poland,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.240
beginning the Second World War
that devastated Europe.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.240
Spain remained neutral, but suffered
scarcity of food and extreme hardship.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.410
RAPID GROWTH
(1939-1946)

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.820
Despite the difficult conditions,
Father Josemaría immediately resumed

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.960
his activities in Madrid,
and Opus Dei began to grow rapidly.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.100
It spread to other Spanish cities,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.940
and in 1944, three lay members,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.520
all engineers, became
the first priests of Opus Dei.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.520
THE ROMAN YEARS
(1946-1975)

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.770
From the beginning,
Escrivá had seen that Opus Dei

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.580
would be for all people
and for all time.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.670
In 1946 he travelled to Rome
to seek Vatican approval,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.240
so that international expansion could begin.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.920
He would live there for the rest of his life.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.530
By the mid 1970s,
Opus Dei would be flourishing

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.150
in over 30 countries on six continents.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.510
Fr. Josemaría wanted to personally

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.840
teach members from all the new countries,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.030
so he oversaw the building
of a large complex in Rome

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.190
where young members could gather
and study Christian doctrine,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.460
and then return to their countries to spread it

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.600
along with the message of Opus Dei.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.270
He really threw himself into this
“battle of formation,” as he called it.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.100
He spent hours and hours
talking with his sons and daughters

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.950
and the optimism and confidence
with which he did it was truly inspiring.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.520
THE FINAL JOURNEYS
(1970-1975)

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.430
Beginning in 1970, Fr. Josemaría made 
long catechetical trips

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.110
where he would meet with large groups
of Opus Dei members and their friends,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.380
to strengthen them in their Christian faith.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.140
It is the sanctification of work.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.330
It is to say to each Christian,
whatever his job or position in life...

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.090
that there, where he is,
he can and ought to be a good son of God.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.090
On June 26th, 1975,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.540
he died suddenly
of a heart attack

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.080
and was buried in the church
of Our Lady of Peace

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.080
in the central headquarters of Opus Dei
in Rome.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.130
Immediately, people around the world

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.660
began to pray to him for all their needs.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.860
On October 6th, 2002,

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.910
before an enormous crowd
in St. Peter’s Square,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.380
Pope John Paul II
declared him to be a saint

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.700
referring to him
as “the saint of ordinary life.”
